# The Daily Scrape

The Daily Scrape is a full-stack web app which scrapes [The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/) for headlines, displays them, and allows you to save articles for later reading. The ability to save comments to saved articles will be forthcoming in a future update.

## Instructions

Use of the site is simple. Simply click "Scrape the latest headlines" to get the most recent headlines. The title and link for each article is saved in a MongoDB database. Each article has a "save" button which moves the articles from the primary database collection to a "saved articles" collection. You can click "View saved articles" to view these articles.
